# INTRO

This is a possible solution to the codecademy project e-commerse at the end of the 
full-stack engineer path. It tends to replicate the functionality of a webstore.
In this state the project is not suited for production deployment, it is rather a prototype to
showcase the understanding and implementation of the PERN stack in developing a webstore.
Won't include any environment configuration, since it is too cumbersome. However if you are
interested in how it works, I deployed it on render:
